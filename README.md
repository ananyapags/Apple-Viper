# Apple-Viper

- This was my first deployable project using Python and Turtle. Turtle is a Graphics library in Python that is great for basic drawings and games.
  The goal was to use this opportunity to introduce myself to real-life applications of Python while also creating a fun game that my friends and I could play.
- For me, this project was a great learning experience not only for a first project but tested my critical problem-solving. I had to think of ways to create a more fluid snake growth and utilize a data structure (rather than a Turtle. Using basic components of Python and putting it together to create a more complicated game was fun as it showed me how much I can make with my current knowledge.
- I would say the most exciting part of this project was working on implementing the high-score system. It allows continuity in my game, urging users to come back for a second, third, or fourth round. Really made me think about how developers can build a "fan-base” just by adding an incentive to return. Bonus: It ended up being a straightforward implementation— with an extra loop
